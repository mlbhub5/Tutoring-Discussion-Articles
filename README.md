# [Original Article - Critical thinking training: 5 key lessons for employees ](https://bigthink.com/plus/critical-thinking-training/)
### Critical thinking is ranked as one of the most important skills for success in the workplace, yet only 39% of employers agree that recent college graduates are well-prepared in this area. Consequently, learning and development leaders are increasingly seeking ways to develop critical thinking skills in the workplace. Specific skills addressed in critical thinking training include gathering relevant data, analyzing, interpreting, and evaluating data, understanding patterns and connecting ideas, thinking creatively, self-reflection, self-regulation, open-mindedness, identifying assumptions and biases, identifying and evaluating alternative courses of action, anticipating possible outcomes, testing hypotheses, and making data-based decisions. While some people may have a natural inclination towards critical thinking, others can benefit greatly from training in this area.

### To develop critical thinking skills in employees, it is important to be aware of cognitive biases such as confirmation bias, which is the tendency to overvalue evidence that confirms oneâ€™s existing beliefs, and the sunk cost fallacy, which is the act of making decisions based on previously invested resources rather than desired outcomes for the future. Open thinking is another useful concept to understand, and this involves a cyclical process that includes creative thinking, critical thinking, and applied thinking. In this model, new ideas are generated during the creative thinking phase, evaluated during critical thinking, and operationalized during applied thinking. This cycle can be repeated as many times as necessary to improve outcomes.

### Information must flow freely throughout the organization for critical thinking to thrive, and leaders should no longer act as gatekeepers of information. They should instead provide suggestions for how to best make use of the information that is distributed throughout the organization. It is also important to develop visual intelligence as this enables people to assess, analyze, articulate, and adapt to visual information in their environment. Conscious observation and information extraction are the first steps, followed by analysis of the information, articulating observations, and making a purposeful decision based on this information.

### Finally, it is wise to provide instruction on decision-making as part of critical thinking training, particularly for new employees. Lawrence Summers applies a scientific method to making complex decisions that involves identifying and framing the problem, gathering data, analyzing the data, developing alternatives, selecting the best alternative, and implementing the decision. By being analytical in their decision-making, employees can choose the best course of action.

### In conclusion, critical thinking is a vital skill for success in the workplace, and training in this area is becoming increasingly important for organizations. By understanding cognitive biases, open thinking, information flow, visual intelligence, and decision-making, employees can develop their critical thinking skills and make better decisions.
