Interacting with strangers can be daunting, but it’s a rewarding way to explore the world of people you 
don’t know. These expeditions provide a structure and a contrivance to help you hone your social skills and 
solve mechanical problems. Each gives you a reason to talk to a stranger. You can do them alone or with a
partner. They can be done in one day or spread out over months. 
 
The guiding principle of these expeditions is respect for others, and every explorer should pay careful 
attention to their own conduct. The expeditions are presented in order of increasing challenge, starting with a 
warm-up to help you slow down your pace and sharpen your awareness. 
 
The first expedition is called "Watch and Learn." Spend an hour in a public place, ideally where you won’t 
encounter people you know. Sit still, turn off your devices, and observe people. Describe the setting, the 
most interesting features, and the people. Take note of their appearance, what they do, and how they 
interact with others. Invent backstories for people if you like, but make sure your assumptions are based on 
details you’ve observed. 
 
The second expedition is "Say Hello." Take a walk in a populous place and define a territory for yourself. 
Say hello to every person you pass by and try to look them in the eye. Don’t worry if they don’t hear you 
or ignore you. On the second round, mix in phatic observations, like "Cute dog," "I like your hat," or 
"Cold out today!" Keep a keen awareness of the dynamics of each micro-interaction. How do people respond? 
Are they uncomfortable? Do they smile or laugh? 
 
The third expedition is "Get Lost." Ask someone for directions and continue to ask for increasingly 
complex instructions, like finding a specific restaurant or shop. With each request, take note of the person’s 
response, their willingness to help, and how they engage with you. Keep your smartphone tucked away and 
rely on your memory and note-taking skills. 
 
The fourth expedition is "Compliment and Question." Approach a stranger and give them a genuine 
compliment. Then ask them a question related to the compliment or something they’re wearing or doing. Keep 
the conversation going for a few minutes and take note of how they respond. Are they open to the 
interaction? Do they seem guarded or uncomfortable? 
 
The fifth and final expedition is "Share a Meal." Go to a restaurant or cafe and sit at the communal table. 
Strike up a conversation with the person next to you and see if they’re interested in sharing a meal. Take 
note of their response, their willingness to engage, and how the conversation develops. 
 
Remember to be respectful and pay attention to cultural differences in expectations of eye contact and 
street behavior. These expeditions may not all make sense in the place where you are. It’s important to keep
context in mind and be aware of your own conduct.
